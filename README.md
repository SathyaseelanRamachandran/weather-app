## Goals of this project are:

1. Search for weather status of a city
1. Get enough information about the searched city
1. Let the clients:
   1. Store the weather status by name and password
   1. Displaying their weather history with the correct credentials(name and password)
   1. Changing their name in their weather history with the correct credentials(name and password)
   1. Deleting their weather history with the correct credentials(name and password)

## How is this project done:

1. Drew my idea on a paper
1. Created the frontend according to first step
1. Signed up to weather api providers and got api keys
1. Wrote functions to fetch data from the weather data provider
1. Created or generated many HTML DOM elements to display the weather and local information to the clients
1. Wrote a Schema about users/clients data(Data that you are going to work with)
1. Wrote some sample users/clients data in a json file
1. Created one Route for just testing if it works
1. Created one Route for saving/storing clients weather status to the clients weather history and a handler to handle the route and data
1. Created one Route for displaying or showing clients weather history and a handler to handle the route and data
1. Created one Route for editing clients weather history and a handler to handle the route and data
1. Created one Route for deleting clients weather history and a handler to handle the route and data
1. Created one Route for saving/storing clients feedbacks or messages and a handler to handle the route and data
1. Created one Route for displaying clients feedbacks or messages and a handler to handle the route and data
1. Made the frontend responsive enough because not everyone uses his/her laptop/desktop to use this weather app

## Trying to add more features by clients/users feedback

I plan to add more features on this web app if users ask and I also plan to update the api keys from free to business based on users need
